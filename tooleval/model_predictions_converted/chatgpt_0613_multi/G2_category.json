Some similar movies to 'Titanic' that I recommend are 'Romeo + Juliet (1996)' and 'The Notebook (2004)'. 'Romeo + Juliet' is a contemporary take on William Shakespeare's classic tragedy, where Romeo and Juliet fall in love and secretly wed. 'The Notebook' is an epic love story centered around an older man who reads aloud to a woman with Alzheimer's, bringing to life the story of a couple separated by World War II. Both movies are in the genre of Drama and Romance, and they explore themes of forbidden love, true love, and young lovers.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find specific information about the latest anime releases. The API response only includes details about 'Romeo + Juliet (1996)' and 'The Notebook (2004)', which are both drama and romance genres.

Some similar movies to 'Titanic' that I recommend are 'Romeo + Juliet (1996)' and 'The Notebook (2004)'. 'Romeo + Juliet' is a contemporary take on William Shakespeare's classic tragedy, where Romeo and Juliet fall in love and secretly wed. 'The Notebook' is an epic love story centered around an older man who reads aloud to a woman with Alzheimer's, bringing to life the story of a couple separated by World War II. Both movies are in the genre of Drama and Romance, and they explore themes of forbidden love, true love, and young lovers.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find specific information about the latest anime releases. The API response only includes details about 'Romeo + Juliet (1996)' and 'The Notebook (2004)', which are both drama and romance genres. It provides information such as the movie's rating, country, duration, story, style, audience, plot, ID, and image. However, there is no specific information about the latest anime releases."

How powerful is this high-tech spacecraft's ion propulsion system? At full throttle the engine will consume about 2,100 watts of electrical power generated by solar panels and produce about 1/50th of a pound of thrust. This is roughly equivalent to the force you exert when holding up a single sheet of paper! While clearly not suitable for vehicles which need rapid acceleration, ion propulsion is advantageous to use for missions involving asteroid and comet rendezvous. For these long space voyages which ultimately require a lot of energy, the continuous, gentle nudge of an ion engine easily wins out over brief, powerful, but less efficient blasts from chemical rockets. Pictured here during ground tests, the Deep Space 1 craft is now about three million miles from planet Earth.\\\", 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Deep Space 1', 'image_hd': '9812/deepspace1_jpl_big.gif', 'image': '9812/deepspace1_jpl.jpg'}\"}"

You will need to make multiple requests to the API and store the images obtained until you reach the desired number of images. The API response includes a short link to an anime image, such as 'https://i.ibb.co/NKj4T2w/FB-IMG-16657564485112099.jpg'. By using this approach, you can gradually accumulate the required number of random anime images.\n\nRegarding creating profile images for your project using the Image Service API, I apologize, but I couldn't find any information about the Image Service API.

To generate a QR code for the location in Johor using the Easy QR Code API, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Make a request to the Easy QR Code API with the location information.\n2. Receive a PNG format QR code as a response from the API.\n3. Use the PNG image data to display or save the QR code.\n\nAdditionally, to retrieve the prayer times for the JHR02 zone in Johor, you will need to find an API or service that provides prayer times for specific locations. Once you have found a suitable API or service, you can make a request to retrieve the prayer times for the JHR02 zone. The API response will provide you with the prayer times for scheduling prayers during the gathering.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with any specific step, please let me know."

We can use the 'mailboxlayer' tool for this. However, it seems that there was an error in accessing the tool due to a missing API Access Key. To proceed with the email validation, you need to provide an API Access Key in the required format (access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY).\n\nNext, let's convert the party date to the Islamic calendar to accommodate attendees who follow the Islamic faith. The party date has been successfully converted to the Islamic calendar. The party date corresponds to '1 Jum\u0101d\u0101 al-\u0100khirah 1444 H' in the Islamic calendar.\n\nFinally, for the special video montage, we can create a no watermark video from TikTok. We can use the 'tiktok no watermark' tool for this. This tool allows you to convert TikTok videos into a format without any watermarks. By using the 'tiktok no watermark' tool, you can create a video montage without any watermarks from TikTok videos.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can assist you with for the preparations of your surprise engagement party!",

We can use the 'mailboxlayer' tool for this. However, it seems that there was an error in accessing the tool due to a missing API Access Key. To proceed with the email validation, you need to provide an API Access Key in the required format (access_key=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY).\n\nNext, let's convert the party date to the Islamic calendar to accommodate attendees who follow the Islamic faith. The party date has been successfully converted to the Islamic calendar. The party date corresponds to '1 Jum\u0101d\u0101 al-\u0100khirah 1444 H' in the Islamic calendar.\n\nFinally, for the special video montage, we can create a no watermark video from TikTok. We can use the 'tiktok no watermark' tool for this. This tool allows you to convert TikTok videos into a format without any watermarks. By using the 'tiktok no watermark' tool, you can create a video montage without any watermarks from TikTok videos.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can assist you with for the preparations of your surprise engagement party!"

The error message states that an API Access Key is required, but it was not provided. Therefore, I am unable to summarize the video content and provide a concise summary to you at this time.\n\nHowever, I can still help you with the other parts of your request. To convert the summary into a QR code, you can use the 'qrcode-generator-base64' tool. This tool can generate a QR code from the summary text.\n\nTo generate the base64 representation of a QR code image, you can use the 'qrcode' library in Python.

The second movie is 'The Notebook (2004)'.\n\nTo find the streaming availability information for these movies on popular platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, and Hulu, the agent can use the 'Streaming Availability' tool to lookup the availability of the suggested movies."

At full throttle the engine will consume about 2,100 watts of electrical power generated by solar panels and produce about 1/50th of a pound of thrust. This is roughly equivalent to the force you exert when holding up a single sheet of paper! While clearly not suitable for vehicles which need rapid acceleration, ion propulsion is advantageous to use for missions involving asteroid and comet rendezvous. For these long space voyages which ultimately require a lot of energy, the continuous, gentle nudge of an ion engine easily wins out over brief, powerful, but less efficient blasts from chemical rockets.

How powerful is this high-tech spacecraft's ion propulsion system? At full throttle the engine will consume about 2,100 watts of electrical power generated by solar panels and produce about 1/50th of a pound of thrust. This is roughly equivalent to the force you exert when holding up a single sheet of paper! While clearly not suitable for vehicles which need rapid acceleration, ion propulsion is advantageous to use for missions involving asteroid and comet rendezvous. For these long space voyages which ultimately require a lot of energy, the continuous, gentle nudge of an ion engine easily wins out over brief, powerful, but less efficient blasts from chemical rockets. Pictured here during ground tests, the Deep Space 1 craft is now about three million miles from planet Earth.\\\", 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Deep Space 1', 'image_hd': '9812/deepspace1_jpl_big.gif', 'image': '9812/deepspace1_jpl.jpg'}\"}"

How powerful is this high-tech spacecraft's ion propulsion system? At full throttle the engine will consume about 2,100 watts of electrical power generated by solar panels and produce about 1/50th of a pound of thrust. This is roughly equivalent to the force you exert when holding up a single sheet of paper! While clearly not suitable for vehicles which need rapid acceleration, ion propulsion is advantageous to use for missions involving asteroid and comet rendezvous. For these long space voyages which ultimately require a lot of energy, the continuous, gentle nudge of an ion engine easily wins out over brief, powerful, but less efficient blasts from chemical rockets. Pictured here during ground tests, the Deep Space 1 craft is now about three million miles from planet Earth.\\\", 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Deep Space 1', 'image_hd': '9812/deepspace1_jpl_big.gif', 'image': '9812/deepspace1_jpl.jpg'}\"}"

The ideal entropy for this password is 93.5330 bits, which means that it falls short of the recommended level of randomness. The efficiency of the password is 25.00%, suggesting that it is not very efficient in terms of its randomness. The password consists of the characters 'p', 'a', 's', 's', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'd', '1', '2', '3', '4', with each character having a distribution of 8.33%. The password does not contain any words, repeated characters, alphabet sequences, or number sequences. Overall, the password 'password1234' is not very secure due to its low entropy and efficiency.\n\nThe album with the ID '6lggWd5q9Rh66OkDE1eNDr' is titled 'Northsbest (Extended)' and it is performed by Lil Mosey.

The ideal entropy for this password is 93.5330 bits, which means that it falls short of the recommended level of randomness. The efficiency of the password is 25.00%, suggesting that it is not very efficient in terms of its randomness. The password consists of the characters 'p', 'a', 's', 's', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'd', '1', '2', '3', '4', with each character having a distribution of 8.33%. The password does not contain any words, repeated characters, alphabet sequences, or number sequences. Overall, the password 'password1234' is not very secure due to its low entropy and efficiency.\n\nThe album with the ID '6lggWd5q9Rh66OkDE1eNDr' is titled 'Northsbest (Extended)' and it is performed by Lil Mosey.

The API response includes the image details such as the ID, URL, width, height, orientation, brightness, tags, and code. In this case, the image with ID 10 has a URL of 'https://mlemtech.com/mlems/1575738472990.jpg', a width and height of 1200, an orientation of 'square', a brightness of 'bright', and a tag of 'Dog'. The code 200 indicates a successful response.\n\nNow, to retrieve the details of your recent order with ID 3, you can use the 'getOrderById' API from the 'OrderAPI' tool. The API response will provide you with the order details such as the ID, Pet ID, Quantity, Ship Date, Status, and Complete Status. In this case, the recent order with ID 3 has the following details: ID: 3, Pet ID: 2, Quantity: 2, Ship Date: 2023-07-11T00:45:36.438+0000, Status: placed, Complete Status: False.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!",

I can help you with that. \n\nTo fetch the mlem image with ID 10 using the Mlem ID API, you can use the 'getMlemById' API from the 'MlemAPI' tool. The API response includes the image details such as the ID, URL, width, height, orientation, brightness, tags, and code. In this case, the image with ID 10 has a URL of 'https://mlemtech.com/mlems/1575738472990.jpg', a width and height of 1200, an orientation of 'square', a brightness of 'bright', and a tag of 'Dog'. The code 200 indicates a successful response.\n\nNow, to retrieve the details of your recent order with ID 3, you can use the 'getOrderById' API from the 'OrderAPI' tool. The API response will provide you with the order details such as the ID, Pet ID, Quantity, Ship Date, Status, and Complete Status. In this case, the recent order with ID 3 has the following details: ID: 3, Pet ID: 2, Quantity: 2, Ship Date: 2023-07-11T00:45:36.438+0000, Status: placed, Complete Status: False.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!"
