You need to authenticate your API request, usually by including your API key in the request header. Then, send a GET request to the Video Builder API endpoint that handles video information retrieval. The endpoint is usually structured like this: `https://api.videobuilder.com/videos/{videoId}`. Replace `{videoId}` with the ID of the video you want to retrieve information for. The API will return a JSON response containing the video information. To retrieve the video status, send a GET request to the Video Builder API endpoint that handles video status retrieval. The endpoint is usually structured like this: `https://api.videobuilder.com/videos/{videoId}/status`. The API will return a JSON response containing the video status.\n\nFor extracting a thumbnail image from the video, the Video Thumbnail Extractor API has been used successfully. The image data is encoded and returned in the response. You can decode this data to view or use the thumbnail image.\n\nRegarding the NSFW content check, there was initially an issue with the NSFW detection function, specifically the 'nsfw-wrapper.openfaas-fn' function.

Instead, it was suggested to use QR Code tools to create unique identifiers for each guest. However, it's important to note that this is not the same as generating API keys. There was also an issue with storing the API key, indicating that the current method may not be effective. Therefore, to complete this task, more information might be needed or a different tool that can generate API keys may be required.\n\nAs for converting the length from meters to feet, there was an issue with the 'Unit Converter' tool. Despite multiple attempts, the tool consistently returned an 'invalid unit' error. This suggests that the tool may not have recognized the unit of measurement. It's recommended to ensure that the correct unit of measurement is being used and possibly explore different syntax or formats that the tool might accept for the conversion. If the problem persists, it might be necessary to use a different tool or method for the conversion."
