Click the 'Shorten' button or use the API to receive the shortened URL as a response.\\n4.

I chose Bitly due to its ease of use, popularity, and ability to generate short, customized links that are ideal for party invitations.\\n\\nNow, let's move on to the hashtags for the party event. I recommended three unique and catchy hashtags for your surprise party: '#SurpriseBFFParty', '#FriendshipGoals', and '#BestFriendsForever'. These hashtags can be used on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook to increase engagement and create excitement around the party. Use these hashtags consistently throughout the planning process and during the party itself.\\n\\nFinally, regarding the list of available domains for the short URL, I mentioned that Bitly does not require a specific domain to be chosen for creating a short URL. Bitly generates a short link with a bitly.com domain by default. Using Bitly's service provides you with a recognizable and widely-accepted short URL that your friends will be familiar with and can easily access.\\n\\nSo, there you have it! With the use of Bitly, you have created a short URL for your best friend's surprise party invitation, and I have provided you with some catchy hashtags to help create buzz around the event.

Copy and paste the shortened URL into your party invitation and send it to your friends.\\n\\nAs per my earlier suggestion, the recommended tool for creating a short URL for your party invitation is Bitly. I chose Bitly due to its ease of use, popularity, and ability to generate short, customized links that are ideal for party invitations.\\n\\nNow, let's move on to the hashtags for the party event. I recommended three unique and catchy hashtags for your surprise party: '#SurpriseBFFParty', '#FriendshipGoals', and '#BestFriendsForever'. These hashtags can be used on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook to increase engagement and create excitement around the party. Use these hashtags consistently throughout the planning process and during the party itself.\\n\\nFinally, regarding the list of available domains for the short URL, I mentioned that Bitly does not require a specific domain to be chosen for creating a short URL. Bitly generates a short link with a bitly.com domain by default. Using Bitly's service provides you with a recognizable and widely-accepted short URL that your friends will be familiar with and can easily access.\\n\\nSo, there you have it! With the use of Bitly, you have created a short URL for your best friend's surprise party invitation, and I have provided you with some catchy hashtags to help create buzz around the event. I hope this information helps you plan a successful and memorable surprise party for your best friend.\"}, 'response': ''}",
