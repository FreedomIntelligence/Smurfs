sustainable development:\\n\\n- For Kyrgyzstan, a country aligned with the sustainable development goals, the capital city is Bishkek. When discussing or presenting information about Kyrgyzstan, mentioning its capital gives context to where policies and development projects are likely being managed and implemented.\\n\\n- The currency in use in Kyrgyzstan is the Kyrgyzstani Som. This could be relevant when discussing their economic strategies for sustainable development, as the strength and stability of a country's currency can influence its ability to implement sustainable initiatives and projects.\\n\\n- Regarding the flag of Kyrgyzstan, you can decode the provided base64 encoded image to showcase the flag's design. The flag is a symbol of the nation's identity and could be included in your presentation or display materials to give a visual representation of the country.\\n\\n- For a symbol of unity and collaboration, the star Vega has been recommended. Vega is a notable star in the constellation Lyra and is approximately 25 light years away from Earth. Its brightness and position in the sky make it a standout star, often associated with navigation and cooperation themes. You could use the story or image of Vega as a metaphor for the unity and collaborative efforts required to achieve sustainable development goals. Sharing its coordinates and its significance in the night sky may inspire a sense of togetherness and global responsibility among the conference attendees.\\n\\nMake sure when using these facts in your conference, you tie them back to the theme of sustainable development and how cultural, economic, and natural factors converge to make progress towards these goals.\"}, 'response': ''}",

If she likes seafood, a classic shrimp cocktail can be an alternative as well.\\n\\nFor the main course, you could go for a baked salmon with a lemon butter sauce, served with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. If she is a pasta lover, a hearty spaghetti carbonara is a great option. Alternatively, for vegetarians, a stuffed bell pepper or vegetable casserole can fit well.\\n\\nAs for dessert, a classic tiramisu or creme brulee would be a sweet finish. If you prefer something lighter, a fruit salad with a scoop of sorbet is a good choice. \\n\\nUnfortunately, I am not able to directly provide you with a specific YouTube playlist due to limitations.

Hence, the API has confirmed the lack of similarity between them.\\n\\nIn summary, due to the API error, you'll need to find trending movie videos manually on platforms like YouTube or entertainment channels.
