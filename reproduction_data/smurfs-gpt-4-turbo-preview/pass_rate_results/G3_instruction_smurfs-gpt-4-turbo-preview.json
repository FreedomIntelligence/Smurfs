He was of English, Ulster-Scots, and Irish ancestry.Clyde developed a lung condition that required him to move his family from Iowa to the warmer climate of southern California, where they tried ranching in the Mojave Desert. Until the ranch failed, Marion and his younger brother Robert E. Morrison swam in an irrigation ditch and rode a horse to school. When the ranch failed, the family moved to Glendale, California, where Marion delivered medicines for his father, sold newspapers and had an Airedale dog named &quot;Duke&quot; (the source of his own nickname). He did well at school both academically and in football. When he narrowly failed admission to Annapolis he went to USC on a football scholarship 1925-7. Tom Mix got him a summer job as a prop man in exchange for football tickets. On the set he became close friends with director John Ford for whom, among others, he began doing bit parts, some billed as John Wayne. His first featured film was Men Without Women (1930). After more than 70 low-budget westerns and adventures, mostly routine, Wayne&apos;s career was stuck in a rut until Ford cast him in Hatosfogat (1939), the movie that made him a star. He appeared in nearly 250 movies, many of epic proportions. From 1942-43 he was in a radio series, &quot;The Three Sheets to the Wind&quot;, and in 1944 he helped found the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a Conservative political organization, later becoming its President. His conservative political stance was also reflected in Alamo (1960), which he produced, directed and starred in.

(1991), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as R&#xF3;me&#xF3; &#xE9;s J&#xFA;lia (1996) and Titanic (1997), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan.Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born November 11, 1974 in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Irmelin DiCaprio (n&#xE9;e Indenbirken) and former comic book artist George DiCaprio. His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German and Russian ancestry. His middle name, &quot;Wilhelm&quot;, was his maternal grandfather&apos;s first name. Leonardo&apos;s father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late &apos;Harvey Pekar&apos;, a friend of George&apos;s. Leonardo&apos;s performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name &quot;Lenny Williams&quot;, DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in small roles in a number of television series, such as Roseanne (1988) and Az &#xFA;j Lassie (1989), but it wasn&apos;t until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in R&#xE9;mecsk&#xE9;k 3.
