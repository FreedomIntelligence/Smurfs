The API provides top songs, top videos, top artists, and top trending videos. However, since the country code 'ZZ' is not a valid ISO country code, the API cannot provide specific trending information for that region.\n\nTo create a playlist for your party, you can use the global charts data to find trending songs and artists. The global charts typically feature broad trends without focusing on specific music genres. If you want to include top songs and videos from different genres, you can explore the US charts section, which includes a Genres section showcasing trends within specific music genres.\n\nBy using the YouTube Music API's Trends tool and analyzing the global and US charts, you can gather a list of trending music for your party playlist."

I can help you with that. \n\nTo keep the phone number a secret, you can use the tool 'SMS:Virtual Number:Get Number By Country Id' to find a virtual phone number for the surprise birthday party. Based on the response, the available virtual phone numbers are \"4959802345\", \"8123456789\", and \"3834657228\". You can choose any of these numbers for the party.\n\nOnce you have the virtual number, you can retrieve and display the received SMS messages for that number. The response from the API will provide a list of SMS messages, each containing the text of the message, the service name (e.g., ACME Corp, MyBank, GrocerySavr, etc.), the virtual number (4959802345), and the creation date of the message (e.g., 10 seconds ago, 30 seconds ago, 1 minute ago, etc.).\n\nBy using the virtual number, you can ensure the secrecy of the phone number while still being able to receive and view the SMS messages for the surprise birthday party."

The response includes information such as the player's level, rank (Gold III), win rate (60 wins and 54 losses), preferred roles (Mid/ADC), champion pool (LeBlanc, Jinx, Irelia), and recent activity. The recent activity section provides details about their recent matches, including the game mode (Ranked Solo/Duo or Normal), the champion played, and the result (win or loss). Additionally, the response contains the player's account ID (uvw12345rst67890) which can be used to query the recent match history using another tool or API.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that there was an error while trying to fetch the list of free champion rotations for League of Legends using the API tool. The response indicates that the request to get the champion rotation data was unsuccessful, as it returned a \"Cannot GET /champion-rotation\" error. It is recommended to check if the API tool is functioning properly or to try again later."

By providing the wallet address as an input parameter, the API accesses the underlying database and compiles a detailed list of transactions associated with that wallet. The output includes information such as the transaction's unique identifier, timestamp, involved parties, transaction type, and transaction details. Without providing a wallet address, the API cannot fetch the list of transactions.\n\nTherefore, to fulfill your friend's request, you can use the 'Database:Felina Multisig Wallet API:Get NFTs' tool twice. First, provide the wallet number 901234 as the input parameter to fetch the NFTs owned by that wallet. Then, use the same API to retrieve a list of transactions submitted to the database by providing the same wallet address as the input parameter."

This tool provides information about the validity of the phone number along with other metadata.\n\nTo determine if a phone number is fixed or mobile, you can use the \"Business:Phone Validator API:Is fixed?\" or \"Business:Phone Validator API:Is mobile?\" tools from the Tool List. The previous execution history shows that the user has already found the \"Business:Phone Validator API:Fetch full metadata\" tool, which can fetch full metadata for phone numbers. The API response also indicates if a phone number is determined to be fixed or mobile.\n\nTherefore, by using the \"Business:Phone Validator API\" tool and its associated subtools from the Tool List, you can develop a phone number validation tool that fetches full metadata, formats the numbers, checks their validity, and determines if they are fixed or mobile.",

The agent suggests using alternative sources or contacting a travel agency for assistance in planning a route that covers these destinations.\n\nAdditionally, there was an internal server error during the execution of the task to generate isochrone contours for each park. The agent suggests using the Mapping:SpatialScale Route Engine: Get Isochrone tool to compute reachable areas within specified time intervals from each national park. To generate the isochrone contours, you would need to provide the necessary parameters such as the location, contours, and costing models. However, due to the server error, the isochrone contours could not be generated at this time."

The list of languages follows the ISO 639 standard.\n\nTo fetch the available rule sets for each language, the \"Text_Analysis:Spellout:Languages\" tool can be used to retrieve the list of supported languages. Then, the \"Text_Analysis:Spellout:RuleSets\" tool can be utilized to fetch the available rule sets for each language. The response from the API provides a list of languages along with their corresponding codes, names, and native names, which can be used to determine the available rule sets for each language.\n\nTo spell out the number 123 in multiple languages using the appropriate rule sets, you can use the Spellout API by specifying the desired language and rule set. For example, in English, the number 123 is spelled out as \"one hundred twenty-three\".

The list of languages follows the ISO 639 standard.\n\nTo fetch the available rule sets for each language, the \"Text_Analysis:Spellout:Languages\" tool can be used to retrieve the list of supported languages. Then, the \"Text_Analysis:Spellout:RuleSets\" tool can be utilized to fetch the available rule sets for each language. The response from the API provides a list of languages along with their corresponding codes, names, and native names, which can be used to determine the available rule sets for each language.\n\nTo spell out the number 123 in multiple languages using the appropriate rule sets, you can use the Spellout API by specifying the desired language and rule set. For example, in English, the number 123 is spelled out as \"one hundred twenty-three\". You can repeat this process for each language and its corresponding rule set to spell out the number 123 in multiple languages."

This will help you display all the available pizzas for your family gathering.\n\n- To find any available promo pizzas, you can use the 'Get Producto Promo' API. However, you need to provide specific parameters such as product ID, customer segment, or promo code to get the promotional details of a pizza. Without these parameters, the API cannot determine which pizza's promotional information to return.\n\n- In terms of special tags associated with the pizzas, you can refer to the 'Get Tags' API response. It includes tags like \"EMPANADAS\", \"PAN\", \"PROMO\", \"SANDWICH\", \"ARROLLADO\", \"HELADOS\", \"ARROLLADO1\", \"PANIFICADOS\", \"A\", and \"HARINAS\". These tags can be used to categorize and identify different types of pizzas, which might be helpful for your family gathering planning.\n\nOverall, by using the 'Get Productos' API, 'Get Producto Promo' API, and 'Get Tags' API, you can gather pizza recommendations, check for available promo pizzas, and explore special tags associated with the pizzas for your family gathering."
