This includes details about each route's identification, the stations it encompasses, operational times, train frequency, estimated transit durations between stations, and any temporary or long-term adjustments to service. This information is crucial for passengers who want to understand all their routing options, make informed decisions about their travel plans, and stay updated on factors that may affect their journey timing or route selection.\"}, 'response': ''}",
