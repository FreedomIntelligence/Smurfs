For example, if the event details are stored in a list or database called \"eventDetails\", the function could be written as follows:\n```FUNCTION\nBitlyLinkGenerator[events_List] :=\n  Module[\n    {shortLink, event},\n    shortLink = EventShortLink[StringJoin[eventDetails[1]]]\n  ]\n```\nHere, \"eventDetails\" is the name of the list or database where the event details are stored. The function first retrieves the first event in the list, and then uses the EventShortLink function to generate a short URL. The output short URL can be customized by modifying the StringJoin[eventDetails[1]] part of the function.\n\nTo create branded short links for the event website using the URL Shortener tool, you can use the same approach as above, but with some modifications. Instead of generating a general short URL, you can generate a branded short link that includes the event name or any other identifier. For example, if the event name is \"ABC Charity Event\", you could generate a branded short link like \"abc-charity-event.bitly\". You can achieve this by modifying the StringJoin[eventDetails[1]] part of the function to include the desired event identifier.\n\nOverall, you can use a single tool (Wolfram Language) to solve a complex task like generating short URLs by using the provided tools (Bitly and URL Shortener).",

This will return a single record, which is the cast member whose name you're interested in.\nYou can use the \"names\" field to find the name of the cast member and the \"tmdb\\_id\" field to look up more information about them."

To achieve this, you can start by using the Vimeo API to search for videos on filmmaking.\n\nNext, you can analyze the list of videos that match your search query and categorize them into different aspects of filmmaking such as basics of filmmaking, film production, directing, cinematography, editing, producing, acting, and distribution.\n\nOnce you have categorized the videos, you can recommend specific videos for each category, which will help you gain knowledge and insights into different aspects of filmmaking.\n\nTo access and view these videos, you can use TikTok, Vimeo, YouTube, or IMDb Pro, depending on your needs. You can also research other tools that may be able to help you download or stream the videos.\n\nPlease note that, depending on the availability and accessibility of the videos, some of them may require a paid subscription to access or view. Additionally, the information on the videos may be outdated or may not match your expected requirements.\n\n```\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can assist with.",

Encrypt the event details including the name, location, date, and time on a separate website.\n3. Use the Bitly API to shorten the encrypted URL and obtain a short link.\n\nFor example, if the encrypted event details are: \"http://www.example.com/event.html\" and the account key is \"abcd1234\", we can use the following command to shorten the link:\n\ncurl -s -r \"http://bitly.com/add?a=6&s=abcd1234\" -d \"<http://www.example.com/event.html>\"\n\nThis will create a short link of the form \"bit.ly/<acbdf>\" that can be used to share the event details via email, social media, or other channels.\n\nTo register the domain that reflects the purpose of the workshop, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the event details domain name is available for registration.\n2. If it is available, purchase the domain name and point it to the event details page.\n3. Use the domain name as the short link when sharing the event details to make it more memorable and professional.\n\nFor example, if the event details page is located at \"[www.example.com/event](http://www.example.com/event)\", the short link can be \"[www.example.com/bit](http://www.example.com/bit)\" for the purpose of the workshop.",

Create an account on the Bitly website and generate a Bitly account key.\n2. Encrypt the event details including the name, location, date, and time on a separate website.\n3. Use the Bitly API to shorten the encrypted URL and obtain a short link.\n\nFor example, if the encrypted event details are: \"http://www.example.com/event.html\" and the account key is \"abcd1234\", we can use the following command to shorten the link:\n\ncurl -s -r \"http://bitly.com/add?a=6&s=abcd1234\" -d \"<http://www.example.com/event.html>\"\n\nThis will create a short link of the form \"bit.ly/<acbdf>\" that can be used to share the event details via email, social media, or other channels.\n\nTo register the domain that reflects the purpose of the workshop, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Check if the event details domain name is available for registration.\n2. If it is available, purchase the domain name and point it to the event details page.\n3. Use the domain name as the short link when sharing the event details to make it more memorable and professional.\n\nFor example, if the event details page is located at \"[www.example.com/event](http://www.example.com/event)\", the short link can be \"[www.example.com/bit](http://www.example.com/bit)\" for the purpose of the workshop."

Our approach will be to use APIs provided by streaming platforms like Apple, Google Play, Amazon, and Vudu.\n\nWe can use the Apple TV app API provided by Apple to get the list of movies available on their platform. We can also use the Google Play Movies API and the Amazon Prime Video API to get the list of movies available on those platforms.\n\nOnce we have the list of available movies, we can filter the results to include only the romantic comedy movies. We can use the IMDb rating and runtime information available on the streaming platforms to filter the results.\n\nThe runtime and IMDb ratings for the movies can be obtained by making API calls to the respective platforms. For example, we can use the Apple TV app API to get the runtime and rating information for a movie.

Filter the search results to include only those videos that are related to the conference topic.\n4. Provide the user with a list of relevant videos.\n\nTo accomplish these subtasks, we can use Vimeo's REST API. First, we need to send a GET request to the `/videos/search` endpoint and pass a query parameter with the keywords extracted from the user's question. Then, we can filter the search results by setting the `sort` parameter to `relevance` and using the `limit` parameter to retrieve a specific number of videos per page.\n\nFinally, we can use Vimeo's REST API to provide the user with a list of relevant videos. We can achieve this by sending a GET request to the `/videos/paged` endpoint and passing the `page` parameter to retrieve a specific page of videos.\n\nThe APIs we will be using are:\n\n* `GET /videos/search`: searches for videos on Vimeo using the keywords extracted from the user's question.\n* `GET /videos/paged`: provides a paginated list of videos on Vimeo.\n* `GET /videos/123`: retrieves a specific video by its ID.\n\nTo download the selected videos for offline viewing, you can use Vimeo's API to download the videos in MP4 format, which can be done using the `GET /video/{video\\_id}/download`",

As an AI language model, I can provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to accomplish this task. Please note that while I can provide you with the tools and information that you need, I cannot perform the task for you.\n\nStep 1: Choose a URL Shortening Tool\nThe first step is to choose a URL shortening tool that works for you. There are a lot of tools available today, but some of the most well-known ones are Bitly, TinyURL, and Google URL Shortener. These tools allow you to shorten long URLs into shorter ones that are more memorable and easier to share. Some of these tools may have features that are more suitable for your specific needs, such as tracking URL clicks or customizing the shortened URL.\n\nStep 2: Find a Suitable Domain\nOnce you have chosen a URL shortening tool, the next step is to find a suitable domain for your party invitation. A domain is the web address where the shortened URL will lead to. For your party invitation, it would be desirable to have a domain that is related to the event, such as [yourpartyinvite.partyevent.com](http://yourpartyinvite.partyevent.com). However, if this domain is not available, you can try other tools that allow you to find a suitable domain. For example, you can use a tool such as Domain Hunter Gatherer to search for available domain names that match your criteria.\n\nStep 3: Create the Short URL and Customize it as Needed\nOnce you have chosen a domain and a URL shortening tool, you can create the short URL for your party invitation. Most URL shortening tools have a simple interface that allows you to create and customize your short URL. You can choose a customized URL that matches your party's theme or add a personalized message for your guests. You can also customize the appearance of the shortened URL by choosing a color scheme or adding a logo to it.\n\nStep 4: Share the Short URL\nFinally, you can share the short URL with your guests through social media, email, or any other platform that you prefer. Make sure to include the date, time, and location of the party in the short URL, as well as any other important details that your guests may need to know.\n\nIt's important to note that the selection of the URL shortening tool and domain is not a one-time process. As your party invitation grows, you may need to change the URL shortening tool or domain to ensure that your shortened URL remains effective and convenient for your guests. Additionally, make sure to read the terms and conditions of the URL shortening tool that you choose, as some tools may have limitations or restrictions on the types of parties that you can invite and the content that you can share.\n\nI hope this guide helps you create a short URL and find a suitable domain for your party invitation.

We will first execute the first subtask to collect the necessary information about Leonardo DiCaprio, and then we will analyze the information to extract the information we require.\n\nTo execute the first subtask of collecting the necessary information about Leonardo DiCaprio, we can use the following code in Python:\n```python\nimport google\n\ncustomer_id = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'\nquery = 'leonardo dicaprio'\n\nresults, _, more = google.search(customer_id, query, num_results=10)\n\nprint(results)\n```\nNote that you will need to replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` with the path to your valid OAuth2 credentials.\n\nThis code will return a list of web pages containing information about Leonardo DiCaprio. We need the HTML content of the web page to calculate the year of birth.\n\nNext, we will analyze the information we have collected to extract the relevant details. We will write a Python program to extract the year of birth and known titles based on the information we have. Here is an example:\n```python\nimport re\n\nhtml_content = '''  \n<p>Leonardo DiCaprio was born on November 11, 1974 in Los Angeles, California.</p>  \n<p>Career</p>  \n<ul>  \n  <li>The Wolf of Wall Street</li>  \n  <li>The Revenant</li>  \n  <li>The Aviator</li>  \n  <li>Inception</li>  \n  <li>Titanic</li>  \n  <li>The Departed</li>  \n  <li>Django Unchained</li>  \n  <li>Blood Diamond</li>  \n  <li>What's Eating Gilbert Grape</li>  \n</ul>  \n'''\n\nborn_year = re.search(r'November +11, \\d{4}', html_content).group(0)\nknown_titles = re.findall('\\d+ *(?:The |a |an) (.*)', html_content)\nknown_titles = known_titles.remove('The Wolf of Wall Street').split('<ul><li>')\n\nprint(f\"Born year: {born_year}\")\nprint(f\"Known titles: {known_titles}\")\n```\nThis code uses the regular expression `r'November +11, \\d{4}'` to extract the year of birth, `born_year`, and the regular expression `\\d+ *(?:The |a |an) (.*)` to extract the known titles, `known_titles`. Note that the last line of the known titles is removed to clean up the list.\n\nThe final result of the tasks will be the year of birth and known titles, which can be printed using the following code:\n```python\nprint(f\"Born year: {born_year}\")\nprint(f\"Known titles: {known_titles}\")\n```\nPlease note that this code is for demonstration purposes and may not work as is, as it requires the appropriate OAuth2 credentials and web page content. Additionally, you may need to modify the regular expressions used to suit your specific use case.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if I can assist you with anything else.",

Load the family-friendly movies from the IMDb knowledge graph and filter the movies based on the 'ParentalGuide' column.\n3.

Can you help me shorten the URL using the bitly API?\n\nSubtask:\n\n1. Retrieve the URL from the user\n2. Shorten the URL using the bitly API\n3. Retrieve the shortened URL\n\nUsing the bitly API, a URL can be shortened by generating a new link with a shortened URL. The user can submit the original URL as an input, and the shortened link will be generated and returned as a result.\n\nStep-by-step approach:\n\n1. Input the original URL to the bitly API (e.g. bitly.com/api/3.0/3/url/shorten/<original_url>)\n2. Bitly API will generate a new shortened link\n3. The shortened link will be displayed on the user's screen\n\nExecution result\n----------------\n\n* Input: original URL (e.g. [\"https://example.com/article/12345\"])\n* Output: shortened URL (e.g. \"<https://example.com/article/short_url>\")\n* Implementation: Function1()\n* Result: A shortened URL consists of \"short\\_url\"\n\nQuestion: Can you help me find the postal codes and districts for plate number 34 in Istanbul?\n\nSubtask:\n\n1. Retrieve the database of plate numbers and their corresponding postal codes and districts\n2. Retrieve the plate number 34 from the database\n3. Retrieve the postal codes and districts corresponding to the plate number 34\n\nBreaking down this subtask into smaller parts:\n\n1. Retrieve the database of plate numbers and their corresponding postal codes and districts\n\n* Step 1: Retrieve the database of plate numbers\n* Input: database of plate numbers\n* Output: list of plate numbers and their corresponding postal codes and districts\n* Implementation: Function1()\n* Result: A list of plate numbers and their corresponding postal codes and districts\n2. Retrieve the plate number 34 from the database\n* Input: database of plate numbers and their corresponding postal codes and districts\n* Input: plate number = '34'\n* Output: plate number (34)\n* Implementation: Function2()\n* Result: 34\n3. Retrieve the postal codes and districts corresponding to the plate number 34\n* Input: plate number (34)\n* Output: list of postal codes and districts (list of tuples, each tuple contains a postal code and a district)\n* Implementation: Function3()\n* Result: A list of tuples, each tuple contains \"Istanbul\" as postal code, and \"Istanbul\" as district.\n\nThis is the solution to the previous question. To shorten a URL using the bitly API, it's a simple function that takes the original URL as an input and generates a shortened URL as an output. In this case, the same function is used but with different inputs. For the previous question, a function is used to retrieve the postal codes and districts for a given plate number. The function takes the plate number as an input and retrieves the corresponding postal codes and districts from the database.

Write a report that includes the list of movies and their corresponding availability.\n\nTo execute these steps, a combination of Python or R, and Microsoft Word or LaTeX could be used. The first step would involve extracting the data and performing the necessary API calls using Python or R, the second step would be to clean and format the data, and the third step would be to write the final report using Microsoft Word or LaTeX.

Find a list of science-fiction movies available to stream on Netflix, Hulu, and Prime Video in the United States.\n2. Check the availability of each movie on each platform.\n3. Determine the availability of each movie on each platform.\n4. Convert the list of movies and their availability to a format that can be easily read and processed.\n5. Write a report that includes the list of movies and their corresponding availability.\n\nTo execute these steps, a combination of Python or R, and Microsoft Word or LaTeX could be used. The first step would involve extracting the data and performing the necessary API calls using Python or R, the second step would be to clean and format the data, and the third step would be to write the final report using Microsoft Word or LaTeX. The resulting report would be a professional and visually appealing document that includes the data obtained through the subtasks."
